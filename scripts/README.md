## TheOS - Scripts
These are some custom scripts I use when I could not find other solutions.

### Backlight
The backlight.sh script allows for more control over the screen brightness.
Implement by running the script on a keybind. The first argument is either '+' och '-'.
```
./backlight.sh +/-
```

### Rotate-screen
The rotate-screen script allows for automatic rotation of the screen and touch inputs with an inbuilt accelerometer.
The script is well documented and is sourced from https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/tree/master/contrib/rotate-screen
For automatic detection run:
```
./rotate-screen.sh screen
```
