# TheOS
My personal DE configuration and dotfiles.

## General Information
Occationally you need to reinstall your linux environment. You may have forgotten to install Timeshift 
or you just need a fresh start. TheOS is meant to automate as much as possible of the fresh install experience.

### Requirements
* A system running Manjaro KDE Plasma edition >5.26

### Features
- Install my common packages through pacman and pamac
- Configure my dotfiles at the correct locations
- Install a DE theme
- Install some custom scripts to your liking

## Setup 
TheOS is installed entirely through bashscripting.

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Theeoi/TheOS.git`
2. cd into the directory: `cd TheOS`
3. Run the installer: `sudo ./install.sh`
4. Go through the KDE system settings and configure the installed DE theme

### Contributing
